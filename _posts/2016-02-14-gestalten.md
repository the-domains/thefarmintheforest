# Gestalten 

Gestalten has been my favorite publisher for a while now. The titles they release are always inspiring, well-written but especially stunning in design. I regularly get inspiration from books and magazines and the latest inspiration is the book _Start me Up!_

In a time of a new generation of startups and entrepreneurs, corporate design is redefined. These young entrepreneurs follow their vision and are aware that it is equally important to link a clear mark to that vision. The average consumer is becoming more demanding and seems to be more aware of what they want in a product or service. Quality and beauty thereby seem to be of great importance. New producers are happy to comply, resulting in unique and beautifully presented products and services. _Start Me Up!_ presents a wide range of original examples. Or as described in the introduction; 'A compendium of innovative corporate design for a new generation, an interesting look at how companies manage to stand out in a crowded market. Welcome to the Golden Age of young entrepreneurship.

As a Wedding & Event Planner, I use this book to get ideas for decoration and design; there are so many wonderful examples of typography in the book, to be used for invitations, thank-you notes and table arrangements. Also, the book provides ideas for serving dishes and snacks. One of the companies in_Start Me Up! _is Food Studio, from Oslo. They organize workshops and dinners in the nature around Oslo, under the name _Get Away_. The way they present their products is gorgeously; oil in glass tubes, jars and bottles wrapped with rope and subtly stylish labels and use of beautiful paper and logos in watercolor. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/56bd16f2-4a53-4fec-9c73-31d7f782b8c0.jpg)

Upon seeing it I immediately get the sense to dress a table for a dinner and invite a lot of people to enjoy delicious dishes. And exactly that is the strength of the book; _Start me Up!_has been designed in a way it becomes more han just a collection of pretty pictures; the book is an experience and makes me very happy. Enjoy!
