# Setting the table

There is little that gives me more pleasure then a nice set table. I am a huge fan of [Kinfolk][0] and a lot of inspiration comes from them; there thoughtful, yet simpel and serene style is something I try to achieve in my work as well. ![](https://thefarmintheforest.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/20140830-mirte-rein-287.jpg?w=1200&h=&crop=1)

In 2014 I helped plan Mirte & Rein's wedding. They got married in the backyard of her parents and it was one of the nicest wedding I had ever done. For dinner we set ten tables in a humble but elegant style; we choose sustainable disposable tableware by [tableware bio][1].
