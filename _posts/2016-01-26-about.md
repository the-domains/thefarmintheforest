# About 

Since I was little I dreamed of a farm in the forest. No ordinary farm; a place to be inspired. To be creative. But above; to be happy. For me there is nothing more beautiful than a happy home with happy people in it. And to then share that with others. A few years ago I started to work as an Event & Wedding Planner. I soon realized how much I liked to do that; there is nothing more special than to create a beautiful memory for people. A day and a experience to remember into the length of days
