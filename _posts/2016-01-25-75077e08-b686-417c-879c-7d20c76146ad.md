Rainbow Wedding Cake DIY

I love me a nice wedding cake! Opportunities are endless; flavors, colors, looks, you name it and the cake can be made. There are numerous places to order a cake, but it is so much nicer to make one yourself; not just because it saves money, but it also makes it extra special to serve your guests a slice of your own creation. \[Or the creation of a that very good baker friend\]. Sure, it does request some time and effort, but it's definitely worth it. Last summer I planned a garden wedding where there were a lot of DIY-activities involved. Friends of the bride made a gorgeous rainbow, lemon-flavored cake, that was not only super tasty, but looked fantastic. \[Images in the gallery below!\] A real eye-catcher for your party.
