Her aim: to modernize the building, yet retain the feel of a 17th century warehouse. She\_certainly succeeded in that mission. Although the museum has been open for a while, I am still impressed by the imposing courtyard, the Open Pleyn, every single time I visit. . The roof on the Pleyn was designed by architect Laurent Ney and consists of thousands of pieces of glass in a metal frame. Thanks to this magnificent glass roof of the courtyard it gets a particularly useful function as a central square and as a venue for a wedding or event. Especially at night, the effect is breathtaking."
